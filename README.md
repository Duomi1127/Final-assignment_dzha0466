## Individual Work Iteration-01
### Artwork Instructionsï¼š
Simply load the webpage to experience the automatic animation effect of this code. Each circular pattern scales synchronously, **creating a breathing effect** similar to the inspiration images below.

**No user input is required** - as long as the page remains open, the animation will continue to play. Each refresh will randomly change the size and position of every circle.

### Individual Workï¼š
I chose: **Time-Based**: Employ timers and events for animation.

Building upon our group project, I learned to use **p5.js's millis() function** to achieve my desired effect.

## Individual Work Iteration-02
### Artworks Instructions: 
In this iteration, the animation adds **varied breathing speeds** to **each circular pattern**. Simply load the webpage, and users will see each circle moving at its own pace, adding a sense of depth and making the originally synchronous breathing effect more dynamic.

The animation runs automatically without user interaction. Each time the page is refreshed, the size, position, and speed of all circles will randomly change, creating a unique experience.

## Individual Work Iteration-03
### Artworks Instructions:
In this iteration, the animation responds to the **mouse position** on the canvas, further enhancing the interaction between the user and the artwork. Now, each circular pattern's breathing speed dynamically adjusts based on the distance between the mouse and the center of the canvas.

1. **Closer to the center**: The breathing speed of each circle increases, creating a faster rhythm.
2. **Closer to the edges**: The breathing speed slows down, resulting in a more calm and relaxed effect.

Simply move the mouse across the canvas to experience these variations in breathing speeds. The animation remains automatically generated, and each time the page is refreshed, the arrangement, size, and speed of the circles are randomly adjusted, providing a unique experience for the user.
