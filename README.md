## Individual Work Iteration-01
### Artwork Instructionsï¼š
Simply load the webpage to experience the automatic animation effect of this code. Each circular pattern scales synchronously, **creating a breathing effect** similar to the inspiration images below.

**No user input is required** - as long as the page remains open, the animation will continue to play. Each refresh will randomly change the size and position of every circle.

### Individual Workï¼š
I chose: **Time-Based**: Employ timers and events for animation.

Building upon our group project, I learned to use **p5.js's millis() function** to achieve my desired effect.
